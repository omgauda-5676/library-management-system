# Library Management System

# Project Overview
This is a Library Management System developed in Python. It is designed to help librarians manage book inventories efficiently. The system uses **Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)** as a database to ensure data persistence, meaning data is saved even after the program is closed.


# Features
* **Add Book:** Add new books with ID, Title, and Author (includes validation to prevent empty entries).
* **View Inventory:** Display all books in a clean, aligned table format using Python string formatting.
* **Borrow Book:** Updates the status of a specific book to 'Borrowed' if available.
* **Return Book:** Returns a book to the library and updates status to 'Available'.
* **Delete Book:** Permanently removes a book from the system based on its ID.
